Code and images from the Food Bank Project completed by Kristabel Hilton for Computing and IT degree. Original repository with history of changes is private. 

This repository has been created to provide portfolio access to my previous work, which was not possible until my project had been marked, moderated, and the degree awarded.

Information about this project is as follows (taken and edited from my project report submitted for this module, e.g. citations removed for clarity):

**Improving foodbank outcomes through dynamic prioritisation of demand and enhanced donor communication: a software approach**

*Nature and context of the problem:*

Demand for food bank services is continual but fluctuating, increasing both unpredictably in response to social issues such as unemployment or the cost of living, and predictably during seasonal events such as Christmas.  During the summer holidays, families whose children are eligible for free school meals during term time may turn to food banks to meet their needs.  In addition to supplying emergency food parcels, many food banks provide other assistance to service users so efficiency is essential to support them in this vital work.  

The problem identified is twofold.  Firstly, the priority list (items most urgently needed at that time) is not updated frequently enough, and secondly, potential donors do not see an accurate priority list in a timely manner.

Marketing to increase public awareness of the need for donations is limited to posters (requiring a potential donor to be physically present to view), seasonal (where volunteers may be noticed at supermarkets), or reliant on manual updates to a food bank's social media page by its manager.  These methods are effective but inefficient.

The priority list is manually created by the food bank manager approximately once a month.  Publicising demand seasonally and updating the priority list both require manual effort, creating extra work for the food bank manager, employees, and volunteers, and leading to sizeable fluctuations in stock levels.

*Solution aims:*

The aims of this project are (1) to explore ways to improve the frequency of updates to, and (2) accuracy of, the priority list and, (3) how to disseminate this information to a wider audience in a timely manner.

Automating the process of updating the priority list could increase its accuracy, potentially reduce extreme stock level fluctuations, and lessen some aspects of the food bank manager's workload.  This project will investigate automation in response to inventory modifications after receipt of donations and assembly of food parcels.  To reach more donors in a timely and accessible way, this project will explore the use of web technologies to facilitate donors' access to the priority list without requiring their physical presence.
